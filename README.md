## Description

Trade Botting, just as the name suggests is a web application that is is programmed help those who have little or no skills in crypto-currency trading maximize their incomes each single day. This is the first release and it still in its beta phase. Trade Botting is still far from perfect. Of course, we know that crypto-currency prices are volitile and cannot be 100% accuratly predicted. With that in mind, please be smart while you trade, even with the assistance of the bot. 

Plans are to develop the bot to accurately predict the market in two major ways. Surface Scan and Deep Scan. Unfortunately, the Deep Scan is not yet ready and will not be initiated into the commit of this version. But we might see it featuring in the later updates.

SideNote: Please, we hold no account to your loses if there be any and shall not be held responsible for any of such.

SideNotesInDevAspects: This projects is done as one of my practise in mastering a new technology (React js). So, any feedbacks will indeed be highly appreciated and welcomed.
